# Game of life
### written in c++ and displayed in a terminal

# About
This project is a simple terminal-based implementation of Conway's Game of Life built in C++. The program simulates cellular automata on a grid, where cells evolve over time based on the classic Game of Life rules. The grid and cell states are displayed directly in the terminal, creating a minimalist and retro-inspired experience. At the start living cells are generated at random.
